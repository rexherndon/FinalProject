# Leagues4Geeks

This is my final project for Advanced Business Programming (CIDM-3312). 

Leagues4Geeks is an online tournament hosting website designed for players who are always interested in getting involved with the e-sports community, but never knew where to start. This web application is able to list tournaments, add/remove players, add/remove tournaments themselves, and edit any details regarding tournaments.

This project was made through bootstrap with a SQLite database tied in with Microsoft's Entity Framework Core and ASP.NET Core. LINQ Queries were also used for querying any essential data. This project is also mainly comprised of C# and HTML.

Hope you enjoy the project!
